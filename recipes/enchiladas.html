        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>I get requests for this recipe all the time! I have made
           it with chicken and leftover Thanksgiving turkey as well, but beef is my favorite!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (3 pound) beef roast</li>
            <li>3 cups tequila</li>
            <li>3 jalapeno peppers, seeded and diced</li>
            <li>6 cloves garlic, smashed and diced</li>
            <li>3 cups uncooked rice</li>
            <li>2 (15 ounce) cans black beans, rinsed and drained</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) can refried beans</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine beef roast, tequila, jalapeno peppers,
                and garlic in a slow cooker. Cover and cook on Low until tender, 12 to 18 hours.</li>
            <li>Shred beef using 2 forks; let it cool, about 30 minutes. 
                Transfer shredded beef to a plate using a slotted spoon,
                reserving cooking liquid in the slow cooker.</li>
            <li>Pour reserved cooking liquid into a large pot; stir in rice. 
                Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover,
                and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
